The following new features and notable changes since version 0.39.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [New `-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage` option added](#new-xxcodecachetotalmaxrampercentage-option-added)
- [VM starts with a warning message after the container detection fails](#vm-starts-with-a-warning-message-after-the-container-detection-fails)

## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.40.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17 and 20.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### New `-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage` option added

In environments with low physical memory availability, the VM might use too much memory for JIT code caches, leaving little memory for critical operations. With the `-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage` option, you can set an upper limit for the total code cache size, where the upper limit is specified as a percentage of the physical memory the VM process is allowed to use.

For more information, see [`-XX:codecachetotalMaxRAMPercentage`](xxcodecachetotalmaxrampercentage.md).

### VM starts with a warning message after the container detection fails

If you mount the `/proc` file system with the `hidepid=2` option on LinuxÂ® systems and the VM does not have root privileges, it cannot access the `/proc` file system. In previous releases, the VM exits when it encounters this scenario. From this release, the VM starts with a warning message after the container detection fails.

For more information, see the [Cloud optimizations](introduction.md#cloud-optimizations) topic.
